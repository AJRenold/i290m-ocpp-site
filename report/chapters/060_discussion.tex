\section{Discussion}

Majority of us experienced problems in engaging open source or peer-production community. Especially lack of the documentation and set up of these systems was caused as problematic. A standard, proper, detailed documentation  would help overcome onboarding problems. One of the reasons could be  that many open source projects have multiple platforms for members to communicate with each other - forums, the wiki, the mailing lists, and the issue tracker.

However, all of these are separate systems with their own login info and digging into these huge mines and getting required information seems to be a major obstacle. If all the important information like ``Where to start and How to contribute to the project" and ``trouble shooting areas" from these systems had been put in single place, the newbie would have found it easier to take his first steps in the journey of open source contribution. Indeed, some of the members of this class are contributing in making documentation more comprehensive and organized.

Nevertheless these results might be related to another factor too: most of us are not senior developers. Previous studies have highlighted that junior developers experience certain problems when working on larger projects \cite{Begel2008}. This does not invalidate our experiences, but rather highlights questions related to novices and newbies in open source environment. We have touched on question of diversity, and suggested that open source participants are ``mostly middle- to upperclass males who are mostly from developed countries''. Further studies could examine if there is link between diversity, knowledge of development and participation in open collaboration. Also one might ask, if the organization and leadership model -- which we experienced as benevolent -- supports this observation.

% Second aspect which we explored was the business models and outcomes on these choices. We see a link between the choice of licenses and income of revenue. However, our experiences suggest that licensing question is not relevant for participants, rather it seems we focus on skill accusition and interests.
