\subsubsection{Funding Models}
Within a sample size of 24, a high degree of variance in the types of funding models of open source projects has been observed from analysis of the survey results. 22\% of the responses indicate that funding was received from a for-profit source such as through venture capital investment (7\%) or a direct funding from a for-profit corporation (15\%). On the contrary, a large subset of the surveyed indicated that their funding came from non-profit sources. 24\% of the respondents indicated their project was backed by academic or research grants, 22\% responded that the funding came from donation sources and 17\% responded that the project was financially backed by the members of the core team. The remaining 15\% of the responses indicated that the projects were funded through a crowdfunding campaign such as Kickstarter or Indiegogo.
