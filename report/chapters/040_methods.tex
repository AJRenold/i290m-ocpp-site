\section{Method}
We developed a method to gain broad insight on the open source project joining process and how the management is likely to help or impede on boarding. Our method is based on {\it qualitative self-reporting} guided by class assignments (c.f. Section \ref{opencollaborationintheclassroom}) on the one hand and on a {\it quantitative survey} designed by and tested in the class on the other hand. The overall process is ``declarative" {\bf [Find more appropriate term here]} both in design and results. For instance, the survey was made of questions that students felt important to ask to their fellow classmates. Thus, the study design is deeply endogenous.
