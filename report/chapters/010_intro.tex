\section{Introduction}

Open collaboration and peer production systems comprise a significant
part of infrastructure and content on the Internet.
Practicioners within these systems recognize the importance of
\emph{community}\footnote{Fogel, K., Producing Open Source Software, \url{http://producingoss.com/en/technical-infrastructure.html}} in developing and sustaining these resources.
Paradigmatically, an open source software project is created and maintained by an on-line community that engages each other in productive dialog using communication tools and contributes to
a common pool\cite{ostrom1990}, in a process that is sometimes called ``private-collective innovation''.\cite{vonhippel2003oss}
It has been suggested that the core features of such collaborative
communities extend to other communities of practice, such as those
surrounding wikis, open data, and citizen science, as well.

Our work is a contribution to the study of these open collaborative
communities, with a focus on the process of joining them and on how
the communities are managed, or manage themselves.
We have been conspicuously reflexive in our approach to this study.
The authors of this report are all students and instructors in a
course at UC Berkeley's School of Information, entitled ``Open Collaboration and Peer Production'' (i290m).
Each student has spent the semester participating in an open
collaborative community of their choosing and reporting back
their observations. We have together developed a survey about our experiences joining
these projects, and the projects' organization and demographics.
By administering this survey to ourselves, we have surfaced data
that samples across a wide range of communities and researcher experiences.

Section 2 will elaborate on the context of how we have written this report, as an exploration of this novel method is one of our main research contributions.
Section 3 will survey the background literature which we draw from in
our survey design and analysis.
Section 4 explains our research methods, including quantitative
reporting and survey design.
Section 5 presents the results of our empirical work.
We discuss implications of our work in Section 6, and conclude.
