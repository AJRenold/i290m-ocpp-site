\textbf{The support structures per organization type}

Many communities had support structures in place to help newcomers to take part of the community. These tools included FAQ files, bugs specially tagged as suitable for beginners and formal onboarding material. Below we try to explain how the structure of the project impacted these choices.

In Table \ref{tab:cross_newcommer_organization} we present the overall distribution between these features per the organization model, we observe that the only major difference in this distribution was in the use of specific bugs for beginners; it seems that especially the groups with (benevolent) dictators do not use this feature, whereas in other structures this was more applied onboarding technique. (What this means? Maybe add some quotes from blogs?)
 
\begin{table}
\begin{tabular}{|c|c|c|c|c|c|c|c|}
\hline
 & (benevolent) dictatorship & self organized & hierarchized & tyranny of unstuctureness & foundation & $n$ & difference \\
\hline
FAQ & 10 & 3 & 2 & 1 & 1 & 21 & n.s. \\
\hline
Bugs for newcommers & 4 & 4 & 1 & 2 & 1 & 21 & ** \\
\hline
Onboarding material & 7 & 2 & 2 & 0 & 0 & 18 & n.s. \\
\hline
\end{tabular}

\end{table}
 
As seen in Table \ref{tab:cross_newcommer_type}, there is not a large difference between the open source projects per type. In all groups, the FAQ is most commonly used feature, where as onboarding materials were most popular in corporation used open source projects and less used in other projects; in Newcommer bugs the situation is different, they are more used in community and academic projects, and in lesser degree in corporation lead open source projects.
