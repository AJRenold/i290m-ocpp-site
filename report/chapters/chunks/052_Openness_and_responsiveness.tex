\mysubsubsection{Openness and responsiveness}
Many report that the openness of the community has been important when joining. This means that openness had to be one of the goals of the project and they actively searched for information about how to join and how other people joined. The more information that was available to more likely people wanted to join. Also responsiveness is reported by many as an important factor. Many wrote to the mailing list or tried to contact the community before committing work. The quality and quantity of the initial communication set the stage of how the community was perceived. It is not surprising that positive feedback was motivating people to contribute.
