\subsubsection{Meta-Analysis}
In the begining of a class we read a paper [insert reference] in which 30 authors wrote a paper
about the process of writing a paper with 30 authors. This paper was largely an experiment of sorts
surrounding things we had been learning in class, it was a chance for us to test out new theories 
of collaborative work.

I think much of that needs to be questioned. There is most definitely room for improvement. This
is the place for that discussion; the meta-analysis.

Some interesting questions:
Would this report have been successfully written if we weren't taking this class for a grade?
Have we produced anything of value?
What tools would have made this project easier?
