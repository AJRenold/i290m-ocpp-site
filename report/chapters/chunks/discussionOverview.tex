\mysubsubsection{Meta-Analysis}
In the begining of the class we read a paper \cite{tomlinson2012} in which 30 authors wrote a paper
about the process of writing a paper with 30 authors. This paper was largely an experiment of sorts
surrounding things we had been learning in class, it was a chance for us to test out new theories 
of collaborative work.

I think much of that needs to be questioned. There is most definitely room for improvement. This
is the place for that discussion; the meta-analysis.

Some interesting questions:
Would this report have been successfully written if we weren't taking this class for a grade?
Have we produced anything of value?
What tools would have made this project easier? 
How do you write with so many other people? How can you achieve a consistent tone and style? 
Will anyone notice that I've just written the word fuck? If not, what kind of editorial oversight 
is needed for these kinds of projects?

Ultimately, I/we wonder, how can we say anything? Many of us have different experiences that lead 
us to disagree with each other, and in a system where we are all weighted equally... how can we make 
a decision on what to write?

Speaking for myself (am I allowed to do this?), I wonder what a paper with 30 equal authors making 
equal contributions really means. If I put my name on it is it an endorsement of everything that has 
been said, or is it simply tied to my contributions? Will I be allowed to have a controversial opinion 
or will it be edited out of the final report? We shall see.

Either way, this is the discussion section, a place for people who have been part of this experiment 
to voice their experience of writing this paper, disagreements, and more.
