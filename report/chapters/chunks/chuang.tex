\subsubsection{Exploring Alternative Projects to Join}

A significant portion (~40\%) of the class had a clear idea at the beginning of the semester which project they wanted to join, and did not consider alternative projects. The majority of the class, however, spent some time investigating other open-source projects before settling on their selected project. The alternatives were rejected for a variety of reasons. Some projects were seen as having enough contributors; others were seen as not open to outsiders; {\bold (add more reasons)}. Three students actively sought to join a project but were frustrated in their attempts, due to a lack of response from the community, or more generally a outside appearance of {\italic closeness} of the community.\footnote{The three projects are Bitcoin, Chromium, and Mozilla Open Badges.}
