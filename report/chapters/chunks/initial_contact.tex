\subsubsection{From lurking to first contact}
Most of the participants answered that they {\bf have been lurking} prior to contacting the project, although the days of lurking are widely spread among the projects. {\it 21\%} answered that the question is not applicable for them and their project. 
About half of the people used mail to get into contact with the community (either through a private mail or to the mailing list). Social media was only used by one participant \footnote{Fogel pointed out that social networks might have an impact on OS, but the impact is still not well understood.}. This suggests that mail is still the main form of communication, at least for initial communication.
