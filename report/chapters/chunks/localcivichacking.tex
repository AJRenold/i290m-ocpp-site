\mysubsubsection{Local Civic Open-Source and Peer Collaboration}

As the digital age has progressed, there's been an increase in the democratization of information. Government, powerful corporations, privileged elites, academic institutions, scholars and politicians, etc. no longer
maintain a stronghold on information. The public now plays a crucial part in the acquisition, creation and sharing of information at the city, state and 
national levels through Internet technologies. Code for America, a non-partisan, non-political organization, forms a partnership between its fellows, comprised of web developers, designers and entrepreneurs, and city governments in order to help them upgrade outdated technological systems by leveraging open-source software, utilizing open data and information to built civic-oriented applications, in addition to mobilizing citizen engagement within the community through a national platform. 

The open-source projects, like LocalWiki, a grassroots organization working to collect, share and open the worldâ€™s local knowledge, provides local city residents the technological platform for solving community issues, promoting civic engagement and awareness as well as allowing denizens the ability to collaborate and built a unified vision for the future under a unified source.
