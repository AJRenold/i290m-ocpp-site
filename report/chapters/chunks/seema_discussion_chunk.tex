ubsubsection {\bold Discussion}
\newline
A lot of the problems faced by people joining open source projects can be traced back to lack of proper communication or discussion. Inadequate documentation, unanswered questions, lack of email communication all point to the absence of a good discussion forum that can replace the synchronous nature of face to face meetings. Many members of the class are part of the same open source projects and they reported discussing problems, progress, and even ideology and philosophy behind their projects when they met in person. Discussions about the ideology behind projects are lengthy and require a lot of deliberation. As this is rarely the case in a majority of open source projects which have many remote contributors who never/rarely meet in person, a question that comes to mind is whether the ideology behind most open source projects is ever questioned at all.

Furthermore, meeting in person and having open discussions also fosters a feeling of community among the members. In case of open source communities which rely heavily on documentation and FAQs to onboard new members with no or little direct communication, it might have a big impact on the motivation of new comers to contribute as they might not feel like a part of the community.
