\subsubsection{True Motivations for Open Source Contribution}
{\bold 42. What do you want to get in return for your contribution?} My reason for asking about contributor motivation is to figure out if people really want anything in return for volunteering their time. Time is money, and it would be naive to think that everyone is truly altruistic. Out of 24 responses, a {\italic staggering} 50% want more experience in open source communities. This should be taken with a grain of salt because respondents are class peers. However, 25% are looking for career advancement or “nothing at all”, while a few receive satisfaction, skills, societal benefit, and web development experience from contributing. It is apparent that career advancement is a major reason for open source collaboration. Strangely enough, an equal amount of people want nothing at all, and only 2 respondents wanted academic recognition. Our sample size is small and academically biased, so it will be interesting extrapolate from a larger and more diverse sample size.
