\subsubsection{Commentary on the Process of Writing This Report}
Commentary on the process of writing this report: I’m lost. I can’t see what others are writing and I have no perspective on how this paragraph will fit into the larger whole. Will it just fit? Will it be meaningful? Will it exist in a flow of thought? All of this makes me wonder how far we need to come with collaborative writing and coding tools. There needs to be a better vantage point of what others are doing and what needs to be done. GitHub provides some of this, but it’s not in real time. Google docs is in real time, but it’s uncontrolled chaos if 30 people are writing. What would a system in the middle look like?
