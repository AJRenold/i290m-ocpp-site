\mysubsubsection{Stream of conscious musings on the writing of this report}
I'm lost. I can't see what others are writing and I have no perspective on how this paragraph will fit into the larger whole. Will it just fit? Will it be meaningful? Will it exist in a flow of thought? All of this makes me wonder how far we need to come with collaborative writing and coding tools. There needs to be a better vantage point of what others are doing and what needs to be done. GitHub provides some of this, but it's not in real time. Google docs is in real time, but it's uncontrolled chaos if 30 people are writing. What would a system in the middle look like?

I am finding the process surrounding the production of this report quite challenging and confusing. Prose writing is much less easily modularized than code; I feel too siloed from my co-authors to make what feels like a helpful contribution, and the chaos of this process compared to other editorial processes I have been a part of is, in my opinion, ill-suited to a high-quality end product.
