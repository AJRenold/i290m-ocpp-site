\mysubsubsection{Onboarding Problems}
$25\%$ of the people reported that lack of proper documentation is the biggest problem they faced while contributing to open source projects. This makes the joining process very time consuming, which trigger delays before the very first contribution can actually be done. When a project involves software development,  having an up and running installation to tinker with is an another important onboarding issue. Some respondents ($19\%$) contributing to technical open source projects reported that they had troubles with installing and running the software on their machines. In spite of the availability of the documentation, they could not find a solution to their problems. The responses to their mails are very cryptic and are mostly stuck with solving the problem on their own, resulting in wastage of time. Similar to this issue is the high complexity of the code base which required lot of time to even understand the project. Because of this it has been hard to get up to speed and make a contribution to a current need or issue in the project.

Another major problem reported is the lack of sense of community in the open source projects respondents wanted to join (\todo{does it come from other in Figure \ref{fig:problem_faced}}). Some complained that they did not get any response or favorable warm response if at all, to their introduction mail in the mailing list. This led to a sense of alienation and fear of contribution by the newbies \todo{do we have any example of someone having left a project because of this?}.
