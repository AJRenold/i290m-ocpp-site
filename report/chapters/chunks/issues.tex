\subsection{Limitations}

Our survey is sample is small ($n=24$), and therefore the statistical analysis should be considered more indicatory than rigorous. When needed, we have used testing procedures suitable for small data analysis, such as Fisher's exact tests. Even while this is controlled in the analysis, several students have participated in the same projects, and therefore the project descriptives are skewed towards those projects. So, projects, such as peerlibrary ($n=5$) and hypothes.is ($n=3$) have several entries in our data.
