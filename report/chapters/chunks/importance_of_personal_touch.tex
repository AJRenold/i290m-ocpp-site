\subsubsection{The Importance of Personal Touch}
The questions {\bf How did you first hear about the project you eventually joined?} and {\bf Which technology/tool did you use for initial communication?} seemed to correlate to a specific place in my mind.  Both of the most popular responses to these questions seem to indicate that people were biased towards direct human contact in both choosing and making first contact with their project.  It was suggested in class that this is because we are in a unique setting in that we have direct access to many open collaboration projects and the people working on them.  I am curious if this analysis is correct, or if instead this would be true of most open collaboration projects.  Are most contributors to open collaboration projects people who have some direct connection with the project, or is our experience with these results simply unique because of our specific situation?
