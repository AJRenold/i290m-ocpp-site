This first survey of a limited number of projects suggests some interesting directions for future study. Experiences of students trying to join both very new projects (only a year or two old) and more established projects seemed to yield different results. 

We would like to see future research directed towards illuminating the differences in joining experiences between participants who take part in projects of different ages and stages. 

One participant in a very young project explained: 

“...it feels much more manageable to eventually gain an overall grasp of both the overall structure and many details for this type of early-stage project than if I were to try to contribute to a large, long-running and already widely used project.”
