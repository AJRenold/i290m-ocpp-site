\subsection{Survey Design}

The survey was designed {\it in collaboration} among the class members, and it reflected the course readings and our experiences in open source participation. The questions were iterated and categorized in the class and an effort was made to ensure their good formating and reduce potential replications; questions used in the survey are presented in Table \ref{tab:survey_question}. As the survey was intended for our class use only, we did not pilot it before collecting responses. Our final sample size was 24 responses, nn \% of the class \textbf{TODO: FIXME}. Our idea is that these questions can be developed further in follow up questions based on our experiences, discussed below in detail.

\subsubsection{Reflections on the survey design}

After reviewing the results in the class, the survey was found inaquent in many ways. First and foremost, it was biased towards software development, where as some participants were involved in other types of projects. Also exact questions were found difficult, such as the licencing question (\#nn), speaking of licence families and missing major licences such as Apache licence, and number of female contributors (\#nn) found hard to answer. I\footnote{Matti} attribute these problems to the rather cauothic process of contributions and not enough quality control in the end, many problems discussed also in the previous efforts of academic collaboration \cite{Tomlinson2012}. I suggest that in the future, instead of circa 20 participants editing the survey there should be a (benefictous) dictator chosen to coordinate the collaboration effort.
