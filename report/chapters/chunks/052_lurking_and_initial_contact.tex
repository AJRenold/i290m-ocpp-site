\mysubsubsection{Lurking Behaviors and Initial Contact}
We explored lurking behavior of our students, and found that projects present in Github and those projects having a FAQ had longer lurking times, where as projects having formal on boarding material had or beginner bugs identified made lurking time lower (see Table \ref{tab:lurking_time_regression}). This model has rather good fitness (adj. $r^2$ 0.134); however other than the Github factor fail to achieve statistical significance\footnote{Without the beginner bug question, we can report significantly higher adj. $r^2$ in 0.185 without effects on other questions significance}.

\begin{table}
\begin{tabular}{lrrr}
Factor & $\beta$ & stand. $\beta$ & sig \\
\hline 
Uses Github & 2.291\newline1.170 & 0.480 & 0.071 * \\ 
Has newcommer bugs & -0.309\newline0.906 & -0.081 & 0.739 \\

These results draw a mixed figure of the phenomena; having a FAQ might indicate complexity of the project or the level of institutionalization, which could explain our finding. However, the negative factor on on-boarding instruction indicates that lurking might not be only about getting familiar with the community, rather also following and understanding the behaviors of the community, often explicated in on-boarding information. 

We found it interesting that open source development was clearly a non-significant factor and that the coefficient is approximately zero, therefore indicating that this control variable has no impact on this.


Most of the participants answered that they {\bf have been lurking} prior to contacting the project, although the days of lurking are widely spread among the projects. {\it 21\%} answered that the question is not applicable for them and their project.

Coming to intial contact, about half of the people used mail to get into contact with the community (either through a private mail or to the mailing list). Social media was only used by one participant \footnote{Fogel pointed out that social networks might have an impact on OS, but the impact is still not well understood.}. This suggests that mail is still the main form of communication, at least for initial communication.
