\mysubsubsection{Timed Commitment}
Seventy-one percent of survey respondents contributed 1 to 3 hours per week on average to their open source projects, while 17\%
committed 4 to 6 hours on average and 13\% 10+ hours on average. None of survey respondents selected 7 to 9 hours on average. This question warrants 
a qualitative investigation to further understand participants' reasons for committing a low, medium, or high interval of 
time to their projects.
