\mysubsubsection{Regular Community Meetings}
{\it Are regular community meetings related in some way to project governance and the ease or difficulty of a joining script?}

Looking into the data from our survey and experience as a class. It seems that regularly held meetings, do help with good project governance. In our experience from class, it seems that regular meetings play a significant role in driving project progress. This may be a result of the general environment, that the course demographic is specifically busy graduate students. In the survey results, it will be interesting to see if respondents who claimed their community holds regular meetings, found the project governance and the joining script to be easier, simpler, or more user friendly. From my own experience with the IPython community, regularly scheduled meetings, whether in person or remote, seemed to be an important tool for decision making for medium and long term project goals. For example, the community holds a meeting along with each release, presently every six months, for core developers. The main purpose of the meeting is to create a roadmap for the next release, a seemly important step for making progress in the project.
