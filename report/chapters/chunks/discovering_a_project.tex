\mysubsubsection{Discovering a Group to Join}
One of the central objectives of this report is to investigate factors that bring projects and potential contributors together. Prior to successfully joining and contributing to a project, newcomers must become aware of projects that are active and open to (or actively seeking) help, with available opportunities that resonate with the potential contributor's motivation to be part of an open source project. In the survey discussed here, we posed and analyzed questions relating to project outreach, contributor incentives, and the quality of the joining experience in order to gain novel perspective on the relationships between these factors for newcomers to a range of project types.
