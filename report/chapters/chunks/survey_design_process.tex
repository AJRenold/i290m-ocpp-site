\subsubsection{Survey Design Process}
To complement our qualitative understanding of the {\it joining process} we decided to design and run a survey. Each of us proposed a survey question and posted it on a Google Form \footnote{\url{https://docs.google.com/forms/d/1KnkSkM3f_QBRQeYfUXpyXspSqavjcClKS2DoWAz1fyE/viewform}}. We then categorized questions by assigning tags : communication, governance, contributions, social networks, joining (to be completed). One or more tags could be assigned to one question and has allowed to draw a bipartite network of relationships between questions (c.f. Figure, to be completed).

Once the first survey design was completed each of us took it. We debriefed the result in class and found several flaws that we described in a separate paragraph. However, the advantage of designing a survey in a collective way helped ensure that most questions would be relevant to most of us.

This is a starting point of course and in the future {\bf this survey could be iteratively improved}
