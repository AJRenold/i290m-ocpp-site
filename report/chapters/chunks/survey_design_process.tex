\subsubsection{Survey Design Process}
To complement our qualitative understanding of the {\it joining process} we decided to design and run a survey. 
Each of us proposed two or more survey questions and posted the within a 
Google Form \footnote{\url{https://docs.google.com/forms/d/1KnkSkM3f_QBRQeYfUXpyXspSqavjcClKS2DoWAz1fyE/viewform}}. 
We then categorized questions by assigning tags: Communication, Demographics, Joining, Infrastructure, Motivation,
Governance, Contribution, Finance, Social Network and Educational Experiences. One or more tags were assigned to each question 
and has since allowed the class to draw a bipartite network of relationships between questions.
(c.f. Figure, to be completed).

Once the first survey design was completed each class member answered the questions. The class debriefed the results in lab and 
found several flaws described in a separate paragraph. However, the advantage of designing a survey in a collective way helped 
ensure most of questions were relevant to the majority. 

Of course, this is a starting point, and in the future {\bf this survey should be iteratively improved}.
