\mysubsubsection{Fitting Together Chunks}

Another difficult hurdle to the process of authoring this paper was fitting together paragraphs written by different authors with very different writing styles and levels of participation. As mentioned previously, a lot of the content of this paper was authored in a vacuum to the content and ideas of other authors. Even the section that I worked on delegated paragraph work by creating an outline of ideas. However, as paragraphs came together to form the section, each paragraph addressed the ideas from the outline with differing voices, perspectives, uses of survey results, and citations of academic papers. Fixing this required motivated participants to sweep through the section, rewriting portions of work to create a semblance of clearly flowing ideas.
