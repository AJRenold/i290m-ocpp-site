\mysubsubsection{Design and Previous Experiences}

Some questions arose when considering how someone with a non-coding background could contribute and add onto an open source project. The first was trying to understand how difficult it would be for someone with, for example, a design background to find a project that would suit their design skills. 

This led to the question of how . Their motivations were clear while mine felt a bit muddled due to the difficulties in joining one. I then felt like it was appropriate to ask the class these two pressing questions; \"How important do you find design is to your project" and \"what was your involvement with open source projects before this class".

Many agreed that design was important to their project, with \"I Agree" holding 61\% of the answers. I was more expecting a higher number of \"I Somewhat Agree" which holds 35\% of the current answers. While I'm glad to know that many projects find design to be an important aspect of it, in hindsight I wonder if I should have rephrased the question to more analyze the role of the design team on the project. I felt like it was a given to understand that design is important, but it's another thing to actually see that the project actively prioritizes design by establishing an open collaborateive design team. 

The results for whether or not people had previous experience in open source projects did not surprise me, as many individuals seemed like they are generally active in this space. If anything I was slightly surprised by the number of \"No" answers.
