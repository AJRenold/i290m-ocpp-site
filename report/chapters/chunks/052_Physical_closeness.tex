\mysubsubsection{Physical_closeness}
Most of the classmates report back that they have had physical contact to at least one of the projects contributors. This can have been through a talk at the university, through other classmates or through work. They report back that this was the initial trigger that made them know about the project by at the same time breaking down entry barriers since it was easier to get information when needed. Therefore many of the project are somehow connected to the Bay Area, which might be surprising as open source project often are seen as international where physical space plays a secondary role.
