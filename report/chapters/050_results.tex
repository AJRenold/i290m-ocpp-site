\subsubsection{Funding Models}
Within a sample size of 24, a high degree of variance in the types of funding models of open source projects has been observed from analysis of the survey results. 22\% of the responses indicate that funding was received from a for-profit source such as through venture capital investment (7\%) or a direct funding from a for-profit corporation (15\%). On the contrary, a large subset of the surveyed indicated that their funding came from non-profit sources. 24\% of the respondents indicated their project was backed by academic or research grants, 22\% responded that the funding came from donation sources and 17\% responded that the project was financially backed by the members of the core team. The remaining 15\% of the responses indicated that the projects were funded through a crowdfunding campaign such as Kickstarter or Indiegogo.


\subsubsection{Licenses}

73\% of respondents (16 out of 22) reported that they do not know or care about the type of license used in the project. Out of the 27\% (6 out of 22) respondents who reported that they care, one respondent only contributes to copyleft-licensed projects and five respondents only contribute to free software projects (permissive or copyleft). The four largest contributors by number of commits (out of the 22) only contribute to free software.
