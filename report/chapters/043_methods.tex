A set of standart statistical methods have been used in this work to share some light into our analysis, however as our sample size is extreamly small ($n=24$), extra care is needed to confirm our analysis results\todo{rewrite?}.

\begin{description}
\item[Descriptive statistics], such as means or distributions of values, are one of the most often used tools in this work.
\item[$\chi^2$] is method used to confirm if cross-tabulated data is distributed evenly or unevenly. Due to sample size, we have not used the standart $\chi^2$ test, rather we applied \textit{Fisher's exact test}, which unlike the $\chi^2$ test does not assume large enough pool of data. We however report this test as $\chi^2$ and related values in $\chi^2$ format for compability.
\item[linear regression] was used to explore the relation of a set of (dependable) variables to one (in-dependabt) variable. To counter problems of small sample size, we report only adjusted R$^2$, however we have not engaged in detailed residual analysis.
\end{description}

For the more analytic statistics, present a $p$-value, which indicates our trust in the examined phenomena. We have accepted values below the 10 \%-cut point as indicators of some level of trust\footnote{This level is indeed accepted in social sciences.}, and indicate the exact value in detail, or just non-significance (n.s.) of the result. This said, results should be considered indicatory.
