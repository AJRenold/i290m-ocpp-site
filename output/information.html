    <h2>Instructors</h2>
<p>Sebastian Benthall, Thomas Maillart and John Chuang</p>
<h2>Summary</h2>
<p>This course is a hands-on exploration of the theory and practice of open online collaboration. Students will engage multi-disciplinary literature about collaboration while contributing to an existing open project (such as open source software, Wikipedia, or OpenStreetMap). Readings will explore business models for open source software organizations, incentives of cooperation and organization design for open source projects.  Practical work will be organized around themes of project management infrastructure, community self-governance, and engineering education through open source participation.  The goal of the class is to engage students in an existing open source community while developing functionality and expertise that can be part of iSchool Masters projects, faculty-directed research, and beyond.</p>
<h2>Format</h2>
<p>The class will meet once a week.</p>
<h2>Grading</h2>
<p>Grading will be based on 20% class participation, 30% on open digital participation (blog posts, issues, mailing list participation, commits) and 50% on personal or collective work, which can be either (i) report on field research, (ii) agent-based modeling of cooperation inspired from the open source environment, or (iii) tools to better measure the collaborative performance of projects and/or peer-production intensity of people in open source projects, or (iv) an empirical quantitative study on open source software data in relation with the tools covered in the lecture.</p>
<h2>Prerequisites</h2>
<ul>
<li>Programming skills is not a prerequisite, but programmers are more than welcome to join.</li>
<li>Students shall come at the first lecture with an idea of the open project they want to contribute to, and which problem they want to address. If possible, a first contact with the community active in the project should already be established.</li>
