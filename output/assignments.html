    <p>Students will be responsible for regular reports on their open collaboration
with outside projects in relation with practical and theoretical topics addressed in the class.</p>
<p>The reports will be blog entries <em>to this website</em>.
Reports will be handed in using <a href="https://help.github.com/articles/using-pull-requests">Github Pull Requests</a> to the <a href="https://github.com/sbenthall/i290m-ocpp-site">course website repository</a>.
Students will need to sign up for a Github account.</p>
<p>As the final project of the course, students will combine their reports from
throughout the semester into a single collaborative report surveying the
open collaboration.  This report will be made available on the web and,
if we agree on it as a class, submitted for publication.</p>
<p><strong>9/17 ASSIGNMENT 1: Hand in links to opening conversations with the open project.  Include any relevant mailing list posts, wiki edits, and forum/issue tracker contributions.</strong></p>
<p><strong>10/15  ASSIGNMENT 2: Blog post about community participation.  Incorporate links to your project participation and engage the readings. Do they generalize to your experience? Or not? How?</strong></p>
<p><strong>10/29 ASSIGNMENT 3: Blog post about community participation.  Incorporate links to your project participation and engage the readings. Reflect on your place in the collaborative network.  How does your participation contribute to your personal goals? Your identity? Your plans?</strong></p>
