            <h1>Assignments</h1>
        

    <p>Students will be responsible for regular reports on their open collaboration
with outside projects in light of the practical and theoretical topics addressed in the class.</p>
<p>These reports are due at 5pm on Tuesdays.</p>
<p>The reports will be blog entries <em>to this website</em>.
Reports will be handed in using <a href="https://help.github.com/articles/using-pull-requests">Github Pull Requests</a> to the <a href="https://github.com/sbenthall/i290m-ocpp-site">course website repository</a>.
Students will need to sign up for a Github account.</p>
<p>Students are encouraged to update their blog posts over the course of the semester as they get insight and evidence from their experience.  Grades for assignments will depend largely on their state <em>at the end of the course</em>.  This means students will have the opportunity to respond to student and teacher feedback.</p>
<p>As the final project of the course, students will combine their reports from
throughout the semester into a single collaborative report surveying the
open collaboration.  This report will be made available on the web and,
if we agree on it as a class, submitted for publication.</p>
