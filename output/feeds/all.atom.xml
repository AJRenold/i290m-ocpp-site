&lt;p&gt;In particular, you will explore &lt;strong&gt;freenode&lt;/strong&gt;, an IRC network that provides support for &lt;em&gt;peer-directed project communities&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Install and configure IRC&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Follow these &lt;a href="http://www.wikihow.com/Get-Started-with-IRC-%28Internet-Relay-Chat%29"&gt;WikiHow instructions&lt;/a&gt; for getting IRC working on your laptop.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Get onto freenode&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Take a looke at the &lt;a href="http://freenode.net/"&gt;freenode&lt;/a&gt; website.  You might notice that their &lt;a href="http://freenode.net/philosophy.shtml"&gt;philosophy&lt;/a&gt; resonates with certain themes explored in this course.  Peruse their &lt;a href="http://www.ircbeginner.com/ircinfo/ircc-commands.html"&gt;policies&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To get onto freenode, you should configure your IRC client to access the server &lt;code&gt;chat.freenode.net&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Join the channel &lt;code&gt;#ischool&lt;/code&gt;. To do that, type the command:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="highlight"&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;/&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;join&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="err"&gt;#&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;ischool&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;


&lt;p&gt;Take a look at this &lt;a href="http://www.ircbeginner.com/ircinfo/ircc-commands.html"&gt;list of IRC commands&lt;/a&gt;. Try all of them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Scavenger hunt&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Freenode is a vast world to explore.  This lab is open ended.  Try to go through the steps below.  If you find anything funny, try copying it into a pastebin and sharing it with the class.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;The #git channel&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Some of you have had trouble using git.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;IRC channels are normally a great place to go if you are having trouble with a project.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I asked in the #git channel whether or not you should come to them with your Git questions.  I got some &lt;a href="https://gist.github.com/sbenthall/6590148"&gt;helpful responses&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Find the IRC channels for all the open source projects used in this course.  Add them to your automatic join list so that you are more plugged in to these communities.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Other projects your use&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Check out this &lt;a href="http://freenode.net/primary_groups.shtml"&gt;incomplete list of projects&lt;/a&gt; supported by freenode.  Do you use any of them? Join their channel.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Your project's channel&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Does your project (the one you are exploring for your assignments) have a channel?  Find it.  Send the name to the class so that they can check it out.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Introduce yourself.  Say you are interested in contributing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Try to determine if the channel has an &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Internet_Relay_Chat_bot"&gt;IRC bot&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Find Karl Fogel and tell him you like his book&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Karl Fogel might be on-line.  See if you can find him.  Tell him you are reading his book for a class.  See if he is as nice as everyone says he is.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Celebrity watch&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You get one (1) point for every person with a non-user Wikipedia page you can find in IRC.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Send a link to the wikipedia page and the name of the chatroom you have found them in into the #ischool channel so others can verify your find.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Play with more commands&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There are &lt;a href="http://www.greenday.net/chat/commands.html"&gt;a lot more commands&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Send an IRC bot into our channel&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There are a lot of great IRC bots.  If you are interested in meeting facilitation, you might like &lt;a href="https://wiki.debian.org/MeetBot"&gt;MeetBot&lt;/a&gt;.  If you like nonsense, you might prefer &lt;a href="http://markovsky.sourceforge.net/"&gt;Markovsky&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you get bored of exploring IRC and there is still time in the lab, try to get an IRC bot into the #ischool channel.  &lt;/p&gt;</summary></entry><entry><title>Assignment 1 - Approaching a community</title><link href="courses.ischool.berkeley.edu/i290m-ocpp/site/article/assign1.html" rel="alternate"></link><updated>2013-09-15T09:00:00-07:00</updated><author><name>Seb</name></author><id>tag:courses.ischool.berkeley.edu/i290m-ocpp/site,2013-09-15:article/assign1.html</id><summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;ASSIGNMENT 1: Report on your experience contacting and explaining your intention to contribute to the community. Did you follow a 'script'? Was it a formal or informal process? Did you face any barriers to participation? Do you think your experience was personal or general? Please include in your post links to opening conversations with the open project. Include any relevant mailing list posts, wiki edits, and forum/issue tracker contributions.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To submit this assignment, please use a pull request.  Your assignment should be
a file in Markdown format with the file name "first initial-last name-hyphen-'assign1.md'".  For example, John Doe should put a file named &lt;code&gt;jdoe-assign1.md&lt;/code&gt; into the &lt;code&gt;content/assignment1/&lt;/code&gt; directory.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Note that blog posts in Pelican include metadata at the top of the file.
See &lt;a href="http://docs.getpelican.com/en/latest/getting_started.html#file-metadata"&gt;here&lt;/a&gt; to learn more about Pelican content metadata.
You should fill out the &lt;code&gt;Slug&lt;/code&gt; field with the same value as the filename, without the file extension.  E.g &lt;code&gt;jdoe-assign1&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Please give your post an accurate Date.  Tag your post with the name of your project.  For example, you might have &lt;code&gt;Tags: peerlibrary&lt;/code&gt; in the header of your entry.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Include a link to the email archives of your project (or forum, if there are no email archives).  Ideally, you should post to the message you used to introduce yourself to the group.  If that is not appropriate for some reason, please provide the next best thing.  We are looking for evidence that you have identified the technical infrastructure of the project and used it to engage the community directly.&lt;/p&gt;</summary><category term="i290m-ocpp"></category></entry><entry><title>React</title><link href="courses.ischool.berkeley.edu/i290m-ocpp/site/article/matnel-assign1.html" rel="alternate"></link><updated>2013-09-15T00:00:00-07:00</updated><author><name>Matti</name></author><id>tag:courses.ischool.berkeley.edu/i290m-ocpp/site,2013-09-15:article/matnel-assign1.html</id><summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;ASSIGNMENT 1: Report on your experience contacting and explaining your intention to contribute to the community.

&lt;h3&gt;Context of my work:&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://facebook.github.io/react/"&gt;React&lt;/a&gt; is a Javascript library applying declarative progamming for developing user interfaces. They provide several contact points for developers to contact them&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Social Q&amp;amp;A site&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;mailing list&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;chat (IRC)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;microblogging service (Twitter)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;From these, I choosed to contact the main developer team via IRC as it can be used for chatty uses. I was surprised by the positive response towards my request to attend the project.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;me: btw; I'm planning to take a course "Open Collaboration and Peer Production" at UC Berkeley ISchool ( http://www.ischool.berkeley.edu/courses/i290m-ocpp ); what I've intereprented from the course materials is that they would like to see us contribute to an open source project during that course - is it OK if I would choose reactjs as my 'class assigment' (and could contribute in the form of documentation most likely; don't know if I really can help you 
person 1: for sure!
person 1: documentation is so important and we don't have good API docs, i think that would be an awesome contribution
me:thanks :) I think the first lecture is this Friday, so I know more hopefully then
person 1: cool, let me know how it goes!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;However, what happened was that we did not have the lecture on Friday and I failed to contact the leaders on this; sort of dropped the ball. Need to focus more on delivering something useful to the community in the future.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;However, this is an interesting point to discuss: many organizations have wishlists, stuff they need but don't have. These kind of lists could make it easier to intitialize the collaboration via an actual contribution, with two positive effects. First, the feature as such would provide some code sample allowing people to understand the level of the future collaboration, and planning suitable cases for him. Second, this might dismiss some issues related to the initialization process for collaboration, as there would be an object of discussion. Naturally one can assume that the &lt;a href="https://github.com/facebook/react/issues"&gt;issues list&lt;/a&gt; would help one to examine interesting parts, and indeed they do have "&lt;a href="https://github.com/facebook/react/issues?labels=good+first+bug"&gt;good first bug&lt;/a&gt;" tag used there.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Then some random personal note, in Wikipedia we can say that the red links could be similar kind of invitations to contribute; check if there's some study on how many articles are created by those vs. starting a new page; what else in Wikipedia, they do have also featured articles for authors to contibute on...&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</summary><category term="reactjs"></category></entry><entry><title>Lab 1 - Github, Pull Requests, and the Course Website</title><link href="courses.ischool.berkeley.edu/i290m-ocpp/site/article/lab1.html" rel="alternate"></link><updated>2013-09-09T19:20:00-07:00</updated><author><name>Seb</name></author><id>tag:courses.ischool.berkeley.edu/i290m-ocpp/site,2013-09-09:article/lab1.html</id><summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;Welcome to the first Lab of &lt;strong&gt;i290M - Open Collaboration and Peer Production&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This course website is an open collaborative project.
It is powered by a number of tools that are in wide use
in open source development.
In order to acquaint you with these tools, your coursework
will be handed in using these tools.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This lab is designed to introduce you to some of the basic
logic and workflow of these tools.
If you find that you already know this material, try finding somebody who is still learning and lend a hand.
Or, dig deeper into the documentation of the tools than we are able to cover here and try something new.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you don't understand what's going on, ask for help and read the doucmentation provided here and linked to.
If you don't complete the tasks of that lab, that's ok.
One great thing about open collaboration is that often all the material you need to learn more is out there on-line.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Pelican&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The first thing you should know is that our course website is powered by &lt;a href="http://docs.getpelican.com/en/3.2/"&gt;Pelican&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Pelican is a &lt;a href="http://www.mickgardner.com/2012/12/an-introduction-to-static-site.html"&gt;static-site generator&lt;/a&gt;.
What this means is that it is a program for generating static &lt;a href="http://www.w3schools.com/html/"&gt;HTML&lt;/a&gt; files from content files and formatting templates.  This makes for fast, secure, and comparatively idiot-proof websites.  It also allows us to back up the entire site easily in a &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Revision_control"&gt;version control system&lt;/a&gt; like &lt;a href="http://git-scm.com/"&gt;Git&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The most popular static-site generator is probably &lt;a href="http://jekyllrb.com/"&gt;Jekyll&lt;/a&gt;.  Jekyll is a Ruby framework.  Because the I School appears to have a preference for the Python programming language, we looked for a good Python static site generator.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After looking carefully at alternatives (especially &lt;a href="http://ringce.com/hyde"&gt;Hyde&lt;/a&gt;), I &lt;a href="http://digifesto.com/2013/08/05/reinventing-wheels-with-dissertron/"&gt;settled&lt;/a&gt; on Pelican for our class.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We encourage you to look carefully at the Pelican &lt;a href="http://docs.getpelican.com/en/3.2/"&gt;documentation&lt;/a&gt; to understand what's going on.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Under the hood&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The most important thing to know about Pelican sites is that all content is written in &lt;a href="http://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/"&gt;Markdown&lt;/a&gt;.  Markdown is a lightweight text syntax that processes directly into HTML.  It is a very popular format that is inspired by, among other things, Wikipedia syntax.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Writing content in Markdown makes it easier to separate site &lt;em&gt;content&lt;/em&gt; from site 'design and layout'.  You can think of this as a continuation in the trend in web site best practices that pushed design to CSS and away from HTML years ago. (Ancient history now.)  Only now, like in a modern &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Content_management_system"&gt;content management system&lt;/a&gt; (CMS - like &lt;a href="http://wordpress.org/"&gt;Wordpress&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href="https://drupal.org/"&gt;Drupal&lt;/a&gt;) or web application framework (like &lt;a href="https://www.djangoproject.com/"&gt;Django&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href="http://rubyonrails.org/"&gt;Ruby on Rails&lt;/a&gt;), site &lt;em&gt;layout&lt;/em&gt; is controlled by templates.  Pelican uses &lt;a href="http://jinja.pocoo.org/"&gt;Jinja2&lt;/a&gt;, a popular Python templating engine that is similar to what is used in Django.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For turning in course materials, you are required only to create and edit files in Markdown and put them in the right place in our course site repository.  But you are welcome to do much more.  One way to do that is to contribute to &lt;a href="https://github.com/sbenthall/dissertron-theme"&gt;Disserton&lt;/a&gt;, a &lt;a href="http://docs.getpelican.com/en/3.2/themes.html#templates-and-variables"&gt;Pelican theme&lt;/a&gt; designed for open access academic publishing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Writing content&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Please see the documentation on &lt;a href="http://docs.getpelican.com/en/3.2/getting_started.html#writing-content-using-pelican"&gt;writing content in Pelican&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Undertand that Pelican content can be either &lt;em&gt;blog posts&lt;/em&gt; or &lt;em&gt;pages&lt;/em&gt;.  This distinction should be &lt;a href="http://en.support.wordpress.com/post-vs-page/"&gt;familiar&lt;/a&gt; to Wordpress users.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Posts, such as this &lt;a href="courses.ischool.berkeley.edu/i290m-ocpp/site/article/welcome.html"&gt;welcome post&lt;/a&gt;, are listed in reverse chronological order on the blog section of the site.  Pages, such as the course &lt;a href="courses.ischool.berkeley.edu/i290m-ocpp/site/information.html"&gt;Information&lt;/a&gt; page, are presented statically and not ordered by date.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We can use Github to browse the directory structure of our website's content.  Content goes in the &lt;a href="https://github.com/sbenthall/i290m-ocpp-site/tree/master/content"&gt;content/&lt;/a&gt; directory.  Blog posts go right there. Pages go into the &lt;a href="https://github.com/sbenthall/i290m-ocpp-site/tree/master/content/pages"&gt;pages/&lt;/a&gt; subdirectory.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;For this lab, you need to update the &lt;a href="courses.ischool.berkeley.edu/i290m-ocpp/site/roster.html"&gt;Class Roster&lt;/a&gt; page with some information about yourself: your name, your status as a student (program, year),  the project you are going to try to contribute to (with a link), and why you took the course.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Git&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We have the site content and history backed up by a Git repository.
You may have heard of Git and/or Github already.
Git is a version control system (VCS).
We will talk about VCS in more detail in the next lecture.
For now, it's time to get some hands on experience.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;If you have not worked much with &lt;em&gt;Git&lt;/em&gt; in the command line (as opposed to Github the on-line social forge, which is different), go through &lt;a href="http://try.github.io"&gt;this web-based tutorial&lt;/a&gt; now.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That tutorial simulates what you would do running Git on your local machine, using your &lt;strong&gt;command line&lt;/strong&gt;.  (You do use your command line, don't you?)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It is totally worth it to learn how to use Git locally.  Maybe you will have to for your participation in an outside project.  For our purposes, we will lean heavily on GitHub, a service that provides a lot of web-based functionality on top of hosted Git repositories.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;GitHub&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://github.com/"&gt;GitHub&lt;/a&gt; provides a web application layer over hosted Git repositories.  It is largely responsible for the wide adoption of Git throughout the open source world.  There are other services like it, such as &lt;a href="https://bitbucket.org/"&gt;BitBucket&lt;/a&gt;, a similar service for &lt;a href="http://mercurial.selenic.com/"&gt;Mercurial&lt;/a&gt; repositories.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;If you haven't already done so, sign up for GitHub and get a username now.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Git is a &lt;em&gt;distributed&lt;/em&gt; version control system.
This is significantly different from undistributed version control systems (like &lt;a href="http://subversion.apache.org/"&gt;Subversion&lt;/a&gt;) in important ways that we will discuss in the next lecture.
One big difference is the Git, especially with the help of Github, enables friendly &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fork_%28software_development%29"&gt;forking&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Go through this GitHub &lt;a href="https://help.github.com/articles/fork-a-repo"&gt;tutorial&lt;/a&gt; about how to fork a repo now.  Then read through this &lt;a href="https://help.github.com/articles/using-pull-requests"&gt;documentation about pull requests&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Turns out, GitHub makes it very simple to edit files through their web interface, even providing syntax highlighting while editing Markdown.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Now:&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Familiarize yourself with &lt;a href="http://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/syntax"&gt;Markdown&lt;/a&gt; syntax.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Fork the course website &lt;a href="https://github.com/sbenthall/i290M-ocpp-site"&gt;repository&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Modify the roster.md file in your fork on the repository through the GitHub interface.  Add yourself to a list, in alphabetical order by last name, with your name, status as a student, external project and reason for taking the course.  For example:&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Gnaeus Pompeius, 2nd year Masters student, I School. I am contributing to the &lt;a href="http://opencog.org/"&gt;OpenCog&lt;/a&gt; project. I am interested in open collaboration and peer production because Caesar has illegitimately seized power and the Republic must rise again.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Make a pull request with your change.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You're almost done with the lab!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now comes the fun part: it may be that many of you have been trying to edit the same file at the same time.
Since commits are made as &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diff"&gt;diffs&lt;/a&gt;, sometimes somebody else's change will invalidate or &lt;em&gt;conflict&lt;/em&gt; with your own.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;If this happens, we won't be able to accept your pull request.
You will need to &lt;em&gt;merge&lt;/em&gt; the changes from the remote repository into your own, and make a new pull request.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Please stick around in lab until we get your pull request accepted.
We may need to coordinate as a class to make sure we don't keep overriding each others commits.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When you've completed this lab, you will officially be a &lt;a href="https://github.com/sbenthall/i290m-ocpp-site/graphs/contributors"&gt;contributor&lt;/a&gt; to the course project.
GitHub provides some nice visualizations so you can see your level of participation relative to others.&lt;/p&gt;</summary></entry><entry><title>Welcome!</title><link href="courses.ischool.berkeley.edu/i290m-ocpp/site/article/welcome.html" rel="alternate"></link><updated>2013-08-08T10:20:00-07:00</updated><author><name>Seb</name></author><id>tag:courses.ischool.berkeley.edu/i290m-ocpp/site,2013-08-08:article/welcome.html</id><summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;Welcome to the website for i290M Open Collaboration and Peer Production.&lt;/p&gt;
