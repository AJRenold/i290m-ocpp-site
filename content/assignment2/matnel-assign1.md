Summary: React and basic history

## Background

[http://facebook.github.io/react/](Reactjs) is an user interface library (and related tools) licenced under the Apache Licence. It is a newcommer in the field, relased May 2013 (based on [https://github.com/facebook/react/graphs/contributors](GitHub stats)). They explain the purpose of the project in [http://facebook.github.io/react/blog/2013/06/05/why-react.html](an early blog post), which highlights technical aspects of the contribution. This was also indicated as the first response given by the project team over IRC:

> < matnel> btw, what is the reason react has been open sourced originally?
> <@vjeux> matnel: because it's a good technology that people outside of fb can use

However, further exploration of the topic (circa 40 lines of comments over 40 mins) highlighted other attributes also:

- improve team motivation in Facebook
- increase level of documentation and robustness of the library
- pr value and potential to hire capable peple
- contributions from outside, both in terms of code and questions

The reasons are clearly driven by practical functions, however there are certain ideological motives also ("releasing good technology"). As this is a company driven effort, it is interesting to estimate the utility of practical functions to a corporation; especially as building an open source community is time consuming task. The intervieew observed this in a positive tone of voice:

> <@vjeux> it requires quite some time to open source a project, but I think the result is worth it

## Community

## Contribution!

A was able to move fast and make my first contribution to the project. [https://github.com/matnel/react-maps](React Maps) is a higher level component to all mapping needs of the project. I developed it based on IRC discussion about the difficulty to have a mapping set up in React (it requires a bit of source code trickery), and aim to develop this further as a code example and a tutorial chapter for the React documentation. I was also contacted about adding this to [https://github.com/facebook/react-page/](React Pages), and I try to push this forward.


 (1) When asked, one potential reason to choose this licence was "approved by layers"



*ASSIGNMENT 2: Report on the history, infrastructure, and demographics of the project.*

 - *Why is the project open? Is it for ideological reasons, or practical reasons, or both?*
 - *How big is the community? Where are its members located? How did you find out?*
 - *What kind of product is it and how is it licensed?*
 - *What sort of infrastructure does it use? Why does it use those tools and not other options?*

*Feel free to ask the community directly about these questions.  There may be historical archived records of conversations about these decisions.  Please provide links to any evidence you use in this report.*

The primary purpose of this project is to gain factual information about your project.  This will make it easier to compare projects systematically.

In addition to this factual information, feel free to elaborate on your personal reflections on this material.  (This is especially encouraged for those who are working on the same project with several other classmates):

- What do you think about the reasons for the project's openness? Does it resonate with what interested you in open collaboration in the first place?
- Would you have approached the community differently, knowing what you know now about it?
- How are you finding the experience of using the project infrastructure? Are they helping or hindering your participation in the project?

Please try to connect your answers to the literature that we've been reading in class.  Is anything surprising, given what you've read? Anything resonate with any of the readings in particular?

To submit this assignment, please use a pull request.

Your assignment should be a file in Markdown format with the with the file name 
"first initial-last name-hyphen-'assign1.md'".  For example, John Doe should put a file named `jdoe-assign2.md` into the `content/assignment2/` directory.  

Note that blog posts in Pelican include metadata at the top of the file.
See [here](http://docs.getpelican.com/en/latest/getting_started.html#file-metadata) to learn more about Pelican content metadata.
You should fill out the `Slug` field with the same value as the filename, without the file extension.  E.g `jdoe-assign2`

Please give your post an accurate Date.  Tag your post with the name of your project.  For example, you might have `Tags: peerlibrary` in the header of your entry.
