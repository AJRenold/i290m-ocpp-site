#ASSIGNMENT 2 - the history, infrastructure, and demographics of Hypothes.is#


##The objective of this assignment##
The objective of this assignment is to describe the community of Hypothes.is. To address this issue the project's history, infrastructure and demographics will be described. The information here has been aggregated through Hypothes.is main communication channels which were in detail described in the last assignment, they consist of a[website](http://hypothes.is/), [github](https://github.com/hypothesis), [mailing list archive](http://list.hypothes.is/archive/dev/), [forum](https://groups.google.com/forum/#!forum/hypothesis-forum) and lurking in the [IRC chat](http://webchat.freenode.net/?channels=hypothes.is). It is important to point out that this is by no means an official statement by the community or core-team of the project, but solely based on my subjective experience of working on Hypothes.is. As I gain greater insight into the project this view is likely to change and I will try keep this document up to date.

##Why is the project open?##
There are several reasons why the project is open source, aggregated they should make it most likely for Hypothes.is to succeed as a project. The project is build on 12 [principles](http://hypothes.is/principles/) which worship the very core of open source and collaboration. By  making the code freely available and by being transparent in the development decisions hypothes.is not only attracts developers, but also interesting advisers who support the project. These two groups have a self-reinforcing power and the core team has been able to accumulate a notably number of [collaborators](http://hypothes.is/who/) by being open.

Another aspect is mentioned in the [FAQ](http://hypothes.is/faq/), where hypothes.is describes that the project needs a critical mass of users for making the tool really useful. They have developed a three point plan to maximize the user base.

1. create a tool thatâ€™s useful even before the larger community arrives.
2. engage pools of domain experts that are willing to help jump start quality analysis.
3. drive sufficient traffic to create critical mass.

The openness of the project is a great tool for all of the three mentioned points. It can create a [noticeable footprint](http://opensource.com/business/13/2/self-promoting-open-source-projects) in the digital community even before the release and this can be used to attract more collaborators. Generally speaking is [Metcalfe's law](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metcalfe's_law) still true, more users attract more users.

##How big is the community?##
The community is very big for a project that is not in public beta yet. There are several groups in the community which I will present in condensed form.

* directors
    + The overall role of the three directors is to lead the project on a bigger scale.
* core-team
    + The core-team is involved with the project on a daily basis. It has currently seven members of which most are developers.
* advisers
    + Around the core team are 35 advisers. They come from various fields and the degree of involvement varies. There are some quite interesting people involved as seen [here](http://hypothes.is/who/).
* collaborators
    + On top of these people are the collaborators who have contributed to the project through discussions on the mailing list, pointing out errors or improvements through the issue tracker or submitted pull requests to the github repository. I count myself to this group of people.
* users
    + Although Hypothes.is is not in open beta yet, it is possible to reserve a nickname. I couldn't find a number of registered names, but I expect there to be quite a few, since the project has been mentioned on all the big technology websites.

##What kind of product is it and how is it licensed?##


##What sort of infrastructure does it use?##


What do you think about the reasons for the project's openness? Does it resonate with what interested you in open collaboration in the first place?
Would you have approached the community differently, knowing what you know now about it?
How are you finding the experience of using the project infrastructure? Are they helping or hindering your participation in the project?
