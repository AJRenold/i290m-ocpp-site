Summary: Details about the second assignment, including history, infrastructure, and demographics of the project.

*ASSIGNMENT 2: Report on the history, infrastructure, and demographics of the project.*

 - *Why is the project open? Is it for ideological reasons, or practical reasons, or both?*
 - *How big is the community? Where are its members located? How did you find out?*
 - *What kind of product is it and how is it licensed?*
 - *What sort of infrastructure does it use? Why does it use those tools and not other options?*

*Feel free to ask the community directly about these questions.  There may be historical archived records of conversations about these decisions.  Please provide links to any evidence you use in this report.*

The primary purpose of this project is to gain factual information about your project.  This will make it easier to compare projects systematically.

In addition to this factual information, feel free to elaborate on your personal reflections on this material.  (This is especially encouraged for those who are working on the same project with several other classmates):

- What do you think about the reasons for the project's openness? Does it resonate with what interested you in open collaboration in the first place?
- Would you have approached the community differently, knowing what you know now about it?
- How are you finding the experience of using the project infrastructure? Are they helping or hindering your participation in the project?

Please try to connect your answers to the literature that we've been reading in class.  Is anything surprising, given what you've read? Anything resonate with any of the readings in particular?

To submit this assignment, please use a pull request.

Your assignment should be a file in Markdown format with the with the file name 
"first initial-last name-hyphen-'assign1.md'".  For example, John Doe should put a file named `jdoe-assign2.md` into the `content/assignment2/` directory.  

Note that blog posts in Pelican include metadata at the top of the file.
See [here](http://docs.getpelican.com/en/latest/getting_started.html#file-metadata) to learn more about Pelican content metadata.
You should fill out the `Slug` field with the same value as the filename, without the file extension.  E.g `jdoe-assign2`

Please give your post an accurate Date.  Tag your post with the name of your project.  For example, you might have `Tags: peerlibrary` in the header of your entry.
