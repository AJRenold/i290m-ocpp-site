Summary: On what I know about CiviCRM decision-making processes, which is not a lot.

<!--- ASSIGNMENT 4: How does your community make tough decisions? What is it's governmance model--
for example, is it a benevolent dictatorship, or consensus driven? How did it get to be that way?
Do you think this governance model is conducive to cooperation on your project? 
Are there hidden power dynamics in your project that influence decision-making but are 
not explicitly part of the governance model? Think critically about the social organization
of your project: could you improve on it? Where possible, link to your community's policy
documents and examples of community behavior. --->

One of the major drawbacks of the Civi community is that, as noted in a [previous post](http://courses.ischool.berkeley.edu/i290m-ocpp/site/article/ljervis-assign1.html),
it can be really hard to get oriented--information is stored in a lot of different places,
and it's hard to figure out if you've read everything you should. So it shouldn't come as a 
surprise that it's hard to figure out how decisions get made, how conflicts are worked out, 
etc. 

From my time at a sprint where both code and documentation were being written, I can infer
that decisions are made collaboratively through conversations among the core team and 
active community members--and sometimes who is included just depends on who's in the room
(literally the physical room or the IRC channel) at a given moment. But I also think there's
a sense that involved people have of when a decision can be made in the moment and when it 
needs further discussion. But it seems to be totally unwritten. At least, none of this is 
documented in a place that I can find. 

After looking in all the places I could think of: main website, developer wiki, the general
discussion section of the community area of the forums, even a regular Google search, I couldn't
come up with much: a [lone thread](http://forum.civicrm.org/index.php/topic,1225.0.html) on the forums,
tangentially related. 

I added a question to that thread, and sent an individual email to one of my contacts. If
and when I get a response I'll post an update.

UPDATE:
Here's what I got from [Dave Greenberg](https://civicrm.org/blogs/dave-greenberg), one member of the core team: 

"In general, decision making is by consensus within the core team with lots of consultation with other active contributors. 
We rarely have a problem reaching consensusâ€”-but on the rare occasion [Lobo](http://forum.civicrm.org/index.php?action=profile;u=12) acts as the benevolent dictator."
