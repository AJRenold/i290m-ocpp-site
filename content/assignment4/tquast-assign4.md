Summary: A outside look at the governance model of Hypothes.is. 

#ASSIGNMENT 4 - Governance Model of Hypothes.is#

##Available information about the decision process##
Hypothes.is is trying hard to on board contributors (see my blog post [1](/article/tquast-assign1.html) or [2](article/tquast-assign2.html)). A part of this is to point to [existing resources](http://hypothes.is/contribute/), however there is no  mention of the decision-process. Some rough ideas/visions are sketched on the [principles page](http://hypothes.is/principles/). Three principles are noteworthy in relation to governance:

> 4. Neutral
> Favor no ideological or political positions.

> 5. 100% community moderated
> Bottom up, not top down.

> 9. Transparent, auditable
> In systems. In governance.

##How are decisions made in Hypothes.is##

ASSIGNMENT 4: How does your community make tough decisions? What is it's governmance model--for example, is it a benevolent dictatorship, or consensus driven? How did it get to be that way? Do you think this governance model is conducive to cooperation on your project? Are there hidden power dynamics in your project that influence decision-making but are not explicitly part of the governance model? Think critically about the social organization of your project: could you improve on it? Where possible, link to your community's policy documents and examples of community behavior.
