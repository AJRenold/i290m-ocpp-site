Christina Pham, 2nd year Masters student, I School. I'm currently talking to [Mozilla Open Badges](http://openbadges.org/ "Mozilla Open Badges") to get involved with their work. I'm really interested in working with them on understanding what people expect to be rewarded for and what they're willing to showcase in their backpack. The primary goal for this is to get a better understanding on human motivations and what aids to someone's sense of accomplishment and positive reinformcent. I also felt like their visual aesthetic really meshed with my own, so being able to work on any visuals for them would sort of be the cherry on top.
