Title: Class Roster
Slug: roster

A class roster, to be filled out by the students.

* Jake Hartnell, 2nd year masters student, I School. I am contributing to the [Hypothes.is](https://github.com/hypothesis/h) project. I am interested in annotation because I think it can be a powerful tool for assessing knowledge.
* [Rodrigo Ochigame](http://ochigame.org/), contributing to [PeerLibrary](http://peerlibrary.org/).
* [Matti Nelimarkka](http://me.mante.li/), Visiting Student Resercher, I School. I contibute to [React](https://github.com/facebook/react/), a Facebook originating JS library. My interest in open collaboration is to understand why (and how to motivate) people to participate and how the cultures develop in communities.
* Fred Jacksier-Chasen, 2nd year MIMS student. I will be contributing to the [Polymer Project](http://www.polymer-project.org/). I'm interested in encouraging and maintaing collaboration in open source projects. I've worked with and on several open projects and am excited to explore what made some of them so pleasant to deal with and others such a pain.
* Peter Nguyen, 2nd year Masters of Information Management Systems student with a focus on Information Systems Management, User Interaction, User Experience and User Interface Design. I am working on Brian Carver's [Free Law Project](http://www.courtlistener.com), which interests me because I closely follow Cyberlaw and IP Law cases whenever they are featured in the news. It is probably one of the biggest areas of contention for the foreseeable future because companies have digitized so much of their operations (and assets). CourtListener is a major resource for lawyers, students, professors, and every day users -- so I feel like I can help a lot of people with my involvement in this project.
* AJ Renold - 2nd Year MIMS, contributing to [IPython](http://ipython.org/)
* Elaine Sedenberg, PhD, 1st Year, looking at either [Zooniverse](https://www.zooniverse.org/) or [Urban Forest Map](http://urbanforestmap.org/), and I am taking this class to learn more about citizen science initiatives!
