Quast Tom, visiting schoolar at I School for the fall semester as part of my M.Sc. in IT and Productdevelopment. I am working on the [Hypothes.is](http://hypothes.is/ "Hypothes.is website"). I am interested in this course because I would like to be able to contribute to open source projects.

Fred Jacksier-Chasen, 2nd year MIMS student. I will be contributing to the [Polymer Project](http://www.polymer-project.org/). I'm interested in encouraging and maintaing collaboration in open source projects. I've worked with and on several open projects and am excited to explore what made some of them so pleasant to deal with and others such a pain.

Stefan Tian, 3rd Year undergraduate student, Statistics/Economics, Considering Mifos but is open to new projects, I believe open collaboration is the future that nobody wants to acknowledge and taking this class will help me better understand this phenomenon
