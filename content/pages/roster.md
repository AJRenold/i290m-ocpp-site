Slug: roster

A class roster, to be filled out by the students.

Fred Jacksier-Chasen, 2nd year MIMS student. I will be contributing to the [Polymer Project](http://www.polymer-project.org/). I'm interested in encouraging and maintaing collaboration in open source projects. I've worked with and on several open projects and am excited to explore what made some of them so pleasant to deal with and others such a pain.
