Sebastian Benthall, Thomas Maillart and John Chuang

##Summary

This course is a hands-on exploration of the theory and practice of open online collaboration. Students will engage multi-disciplinary literature about collaboration while contributing to an existing open project (such as open source software, Wikipedia, or OpenStreetMap). Readings will explore business models for open source software organizations, incentives of cooperation and organization design for open source projects.  Practical work will be organized around themes of project management infrastructure, community self-governance, and engineering education through open source participation.  The goal of the class is to engage students in an existing open source community while developing functionality and expertise that can be part of iSchool Masters projects, faculty-directed research, and beyond.

## Course Details

The course will meet in South Hall 210 once a week, on Fridays from 11am-1pm.

There is also a lab, which meets Tuesday 1-2pm.  Labs will meet in South Hall 202 until we move to [Internet Relay Chat](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Internet_Relay_Chat) (IRC).

This course is 3 units. It fulfills the Masters requirement for the I School MIMS program.

## External Project Participation

Students of this course will be required to contribute to an open collaborative project of their choosing.  This is an important decision; students should come into the class with ideas about projects or fields they are interested in.

A list of potential projects is **TBD**.

## Assignments and Group Report

Students will be responsible for regular reports on their open collaboration
with outside projects.

The reports will be blog entries *to this website*.
Reports will be handed in using [Github Pull Requests](https://help.github.com/articles/using-pull-requests) to the [course website repository](https://github.com/sbenthall/i290m-ocpp-site).
Students will need to sign up for a Github account.

As the final project of the course, students will combine their reports from
throughout the semester into a single collaborative report surveying the
open collaboration.  This report will be made available on the web and,
if we agree on it as a class, submitted for publication.

## Grading
Grading will be based on:

*   20% class participation
*   30% on open digital participation (blog posts, issues, mailing list participation, commits) in selected external project. Contributions can be of any of the following forms, or others with instructor approval:
    1. software code contribution
    2. interaction design / wireframes
    2. documentation 
    3. performance metrics
    5. data contribution or curation

    Students are encouraged to work with their selected community to find constructive tasks for mutual benefit.

* 20% on incremental open participation reports
* 30% participation in final group report.

## Prerequisites
- Programming skills are not a prerequisite, but programmers are more than welcome to join.
- Students will come to the first lecture with an idea of the open project they want to contribute to, and which problem they want to address. If possible, a first contact with the community active in the project should already be established.
