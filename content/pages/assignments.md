Title: Assignments
Slug: assignments

Students will be responsible for regular reports on their open collaboration
with outside projects in relation with practical and theoretical topics addressed in the class.

The reports will be blog entries *to this website*.
Reports will be handed in using [Github Pull Requests](https://help.github.com/articles/using-pull-requests) to the [course website repository](https://github.com/sbenthall/i290m-ocpp-site).
Students will need to sign up for a Github account.

As the final project of the course, students will combine their reports from
throughout the semester into a single collaborative report surveying the
open collaboration.  This report will be made available on the web and,
if we agree on it as a class, submitted for publication.
