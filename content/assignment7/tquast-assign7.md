Summary: Final thoughts about hypothes.is, its community and my contributions.

##The project's community and its technical modularity##
Hypothes.is community consists mainly of developers (See [assignment 2](http://courses.ischool.berkeley.edu/i290m-ocpp/site/article/tquast-assign2.html) for an exhaustive description of it). The community is therefore technical and professional about the tool and its usage, in other words [Conway's Law](http://www.melconway.com/research/committees.html) is at full play here. The tool fits the need and wishes of the community very well, because the community is an active part of creating the tool. How this changes when hypothes.is enters the open beta phase is hard to say, but a change in the community will unquestionably occur. 

##The collaboration structure##
Most of the core-team of hypothes.is is located in the Bay Area, with a few living in other countries. Hypothes.is has its own office space in San Francisco and enough desk space for people me meet physically to work. However, Bigger physical meetups are rare. Most communication happens over mail or ad hoc via IRC. 

##How does it get work done?##

##My contribution to hypothes.is##
Throughout the last four months I have worked intensively with hypothes.is. I have been in contact with the team both personally by visiting their office in San Francisco and through IRC chat and mail. It has also been a great help to be able to see [Jake Hartnell](http://hypothes.is/who/) on a daily basis. I have seen the tool evolve by reaching [milestones](https://github.com/hypothesis/h/wiki/roadmap) and seen them set new ones. 

Together with other students from the [iSchool](http://www.ischool.berkeley.edu/) I have worked on fleshing out the [groups feature](https://docs.google.com/document/d/17HDaujAt5P9o5x2Yinr8jL_tZS_3Zd36VBYbpPz-bkM). Hypothes.is definition of the groups-feature was still vague when we started, and we had to explore the design-space before starting to code. Jake and I decided to work on this problem cross-class as we could look into this very problem in the [UI Design and Development class](http://blogs.ischool.berkeley.edu/i213f13/). 

A few facts about what I have contributed to the groups feature
we have conducted more than 25 user interviews which clarified what is needed and what not.
we have created several iterations of prototypes, going from paper to an interactive one.
