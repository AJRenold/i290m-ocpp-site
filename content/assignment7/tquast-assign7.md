Summary: Final thoughts about hypothes.is, its community and my contributions.

##The project's community and its technical modularity##
Hypothes.is community consists mainly of developers (See [assignment 2](http://courses.ischool.berkeley.edu/i290m-ocpp/site/article/tquast-assign2.html) for an exhaustive description of it). The community is therefore technical and professional about the tool and its usage, in other words [Conway's Law](http://www.melconway.com/research/committees.html) is at full play here. The tool fits the need and wishes of the community very well, because the community is an active part of creating the tool. How this changes when hypothes.is enters the open beta phase is hard to say, but a change in the community will unquestionably occur. 

##The collaboration structure##
Most of the core-team of hypothes.is is located in the Bay Area, with a few living in other countries. Hypothes.is has its own office space in San Francisco and enough desk space for people me meet physically to work. However, physical meetups are rare. Most communication happens over mail or ad hoc via IRC. The internal structure is clearly defined through a combination of Github and mails. People claim areas they are working on and branch them into the main tool after review. 

##How does it get work done?##
People at hypothes.is work independently. This does not mean that there is no communication or collaboration, but the relatively small core-team of six people makes it possible to work with a minimalistic structure. They have worked together for months and are aware of their roles in the community. Whenever new code is ready it is submitted to review and the others review it. Thereby everyone knows where the tool is heading and has a good understanding of what people work on.

##My contribution to hypothes.is##
Throughout the last four months I have worked intensively with hypothes.is. I have been in contact with the team both personally by visiting their office in San Francisco and through IRC chat and mail. It has also been a great help to be able to see [Jake Hartnell](http://hypothes.is/who/) on a daily basis. I have seen the tool evolve by reaching [milestones](https://github.com/hypothesis/h/wiki/roadmap) and seen them set new ones. 

Together with other students from the [iSchool](http://www.ischool.berkeley.edu/) I have worked on fleshing out the [groups feature](https://docs.google.com/document/d/17HDaujAt5P9o5x2Yinr8jL_tZS_3Zd36VBYbpPz-bkM). Hypothes.is definition of the groups-feature was still vague when we started, and we had to explore the design-space before starting to code. Jake and I decided to work on this problem cross-class as we could look into this very problem in the [UI Design and Development class](http://blogs.ischool.berkeley.edu/i213f13/). 

A few facts about what I have contributed to the groups feature
we have conducted more than 25 user interviews which clarified what is needed and what not.
we have created several iterations of prototypes, going from paper to an interactive one.

The final prototype I have been working on can be seen here: (groupsdemo)[http://groupsdemo.dokku.hypothes.is/]. It is not meant to be implemented into the tool as it is, but more as a comment on how the functionality could be realized. We agreed on making it this way, because it was too resource intensive to code the backend while not knowing how the frontend would look like and what functionality would be needed. The prototype shown above has been thoroughly tested with users and all the findings are documented and sent to hypothes.is.

##Conclusion##
It was a pleasure to work with hypothes.is. After having worked with them I am confident that they have the best shot at how to finally make open annotation happen on the web where so many others have failed (see [assignment 6](http://courses.ischool.berkeley.edu/i290m-ocpp/site/article/tquast-assign6.html)). I hope that my contributions were helpful and that hypothes.is will stand the critical look of real users when they enter the open beta. Hypothes.is has great potential and it's vision to free and democratize the web was the [reason why I joined](http://courses.ischool.berkeley.edu/i290m-ocpp/site/article/tquast-assign1.html). Many [influential people](http://hypothes.is/who/) are working on or watching the project.
Time will tell if hypothes.is succeeds.
