Summary: Technical modularity of Geonode, its collaboration structure and how work gets done at Geonode. Finally, my contributions to Geonode and OpenSource software in this semester.

ASSIGNMENT 7: Does your project's community mirror the technical modularity of the project? How does it structure its collaboration--synchronously? Asyncronously? How does it get work done?

# Geonode's community and its technical modularity

Geonode's community involves 3 groups : Users, Developers and Admins. The project caters to these three groups individually through various documentation and online workshops. 
Geonode users use the software and do not involve much in the development of the project. [Their workshop](http://docs.geonode.org/en/latest/tutorials/users/index.html#users) mainly deals with as to how to create an account on GeoNode, add layers and maps to your account as well as publishing those.
