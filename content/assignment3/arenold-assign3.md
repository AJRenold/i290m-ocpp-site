# Contribution Learning Curve

Since the start of the OCPP course, I've had the goal of contributing to IPython
because I've been a user of the software for more than six months now and have
found the IPython Notebook feature to be immensely useful. I also enjoy taking
on ventures that will develop my Python programming skills and since it is a 
Python project, I felt that this also made for a good fit.
I have discovered however, that there is a significant learning curve to joining
a long running open source project led by paid developers. No doubt this is due
to the complexity of IPython, as it is a serious software project supporting
a wide range of platforms and uses. I also believe that this is an effect of my 
own bias that making a meaningful contribution to the project involves a pull 
request with code.

# Time to Contribute

Because I have been determined to make a code contribution, I have gone through 
the process of getting a developer environment running on and have played around
with the front-end JavaScript that controls the feature I plan on adding a small 
enhancement to. What has been difficult has been finding large chunks of time 
where I can sit down and experiment and learn more about the IPython code base.
I feel that this requires (for me) at least 3 hours of uninterupted focusing and
it has been hard to find this time among work for other course projects.
I've only been able to successfully do this one time and thus have made little
progress toward creating a pull request.
