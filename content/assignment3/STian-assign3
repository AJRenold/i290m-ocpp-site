Summary: Third Assignment

To me, MIFOS is the perfect example of the Benevolent Dictator Model (Fogel) with maybe more dictator than benevolent. I’ve mentioned before on how MIFOS is split up into teams and each team is delegated certain tasks from their team leader. When I look at how MIFOS’s “mousetrap” is built(Shah), I can see how this model has its benefits. For example, need-driven participants get timely feedback, start discussions and have their effort noted(Shah) all by the team leaders. In my mind, the team leaders provide an almost artificial hand in giving feedback and positive reinforcement along with criticisms to create a constant loop of contributions and feedback in order to keep the contributor engaged. It’s a substitute for an active community and almost feels like a classroom setting where Teacher is patting you on the back and constantly reviewing your work. 
However, there is not as much reciprocity(Shah) or “Others helped me I should help them.” This is the trade-off with the active leadership model that MIFOS has. The projects and tasks are not as open as they could be because your first step into contributing is subscribing and getting on a particular team which has particular tasks. That extra barrier alone makes it so that really only people on your team can help you. In my task, helping write and modify the new MIFOS X User manual, this becomes almost like a race to the finish line type scenario because once someone’s done it, it’s not as common to change or modify the work done unlike coding. However, at this point, I would like to mention that my experience and exposure to MIFOS is very limited because the tasks I’ve been assigned have all been purely technical and centric to one specific team. This is inherent to MIFOS’s structure and I am thinking about applying to sit in on some of the programming teams to get a feel for their culture and see if there’s a difference in culture between the teams. If I do find it to be true, I’m going to talk to Edward Cable(Community Director/Benevolent Dictator/Head Honcho) if I could sit In on all the teams to maybe do a write up on the differences I find and possibly do some interviews. 
What’s interesting is the motivation that MIFOS tries to sell onto its contributors. While there are positive reinforcement items like Member/Contributor of the month awards, my impression of how MIFOS motivates its contributors as well as any site visitors is through its philanthropic message. MIFOS tries to make its very technologically complicated and intricate product more relevant and reduce the levels of separation through its campaign message “Three Billion Maries.”  Marie was essentially a success story from the use of the microfinance software as she was able to start her own business through her loan and essentially made a better life for herself. MIFOS ‘s webpage has constant reminders of the social impact that its contributors and users are making. Apart from just the campaign and the promotional video which depicts the lives and plights of people that MIFOS has helped, there are numbers and depictions of how many people MIFOS has helped and in which country. This isn’t one of the reasons in Shah’s article like “puzzles, or fun, etc” and I wonder how much the contributors to MIFOS are actually sold by this message.
