Summary: An update about my work for hypothes.is. From initial contact to a visit of their office.

#ASSIGNMENT 3 - Project Update of Hypothes.is#

##Initial contact##
I heard about Hypothes.is at the beginning of this class when Jake told me about it. While there are many open source project out there, Hypothes.is seemed to be worth working on (see [video](http://youtu.be/QCkm0lL-6lc) about their vision). I have never worked for an open source project, so knowing an involved person and being able to meet him physically was a bit plus, so I joined the project.

##Lurking##
My first contribution was to point out that the windows installation guide is not working ([link](http://list.hypothes.is/archive/dev/2013-09/0000058.html)). The guide has been updated, and now it's also working on windows. There was actually already a fix pending in a pull request, but it hadn't been tested by the core-team therefore it hadn't been merged yet. By commenting the [pull-request](https://github.com/hypothesis/h/pull/646) confirming that it is indeed a needed fix they finally merged it into the main repository. 

##Contributing##
It took me much time to get the server up and running since no one of the core team is working with Windows, so I have been heavily delayed with code-contributions. However, I am involved in designing the coming group functionality for Hypothes.is. I am working on it as part of my [UI class](http://blogs.ischool.berkeley.edu/i213f13/). Since the focus of the class is more on creating prototypes of interfaces than on coding something that can be used outside of the class this is what I focus on. Hypothes.is has some internal documents about how they think groups should work and I update them when we get new insights in the UI class. Thereby we can test and iterate on their ideas.

##The future##
I don't know if I will be able to help them after this class finishes. I will definitely continue to watch the project as I still think it is a great project. On the other hand am I starting to write my thesis soon and beside that I have a [company](http://creativevikings.com) that also needs my attention. My contribution to the project will be more like a promoter in Denmark 

##Conclusion##
I think my motivation behind contributing to this open source project has been very unusual. My main goal was to learn about open source development, how to get involved and how these projects are organized. Hypothes.is seemed like a good project to get involved in as it has a moderate size, a healthy core team, backup through its community and an interesting mission. In the end I could help Hypothes.is and by helping them I archived my own goal of learning about open source.
