Summary: Financing CiviCRM

ASSIGNMENT 6: 
How does this affect the community's cooperative dynamics? Are there competing 
projects? How would you describe your project's role in the greater technical ecosystem?



In addition to private foundation funding, CiviCRM has come up with a crowdsourced 
funding model for new feature development. 

It works such that community members -- both organizations and individuals -- new 
features are proposed publicly and promoted as Make-It-Happen projects with a total 
estimated cost for the full development of the feature. The current Make-It-Happen 
ideas are [here](https://civicrm.org/make-it-happen). 

The organization promoting the new feature is wise to seed the idea with some initial 
funding to demonstrate commitment to the development. Other organizations, developers, 
and users can make contributions to any Make-It-Happen project. Those features that 
are compelling to many in the community quickly receive support and get prioritized 
as soon as the funding needed is pledged in full. 

When working with CiviCRM through my previous organization, PTP, the MIH structure 
made it extremely easy to make the case for contributing to a particular part of 
CiviCRM development during a PTP-internal meeting. We could issue our vote for 
development on a particular feature, and thus hold sway over the direction of 
development by contributing significantly, and sometimes even contributing exactly 
the amount needed to start working on a feature. PTP probably contributed more to 
CiviCRM than we would have otherwise because of these very specific targets that 
are transparent to the whole community. 

However, a recent conversation with Dave Greenberg (one of the CiviCRM BDs) made 
clear to me that there is still a need for additional "general purpose" funding 
to keep the CiviCRM project on course. As is the state of many nonprofit organizations 
(CiviCRM's tax status is 501(c)(3)), it is possible to get very targeted funding 
for specific work or programs, but it is getting ever more difficult to fund the 
overhead and general operations of an organization. Foundations that used to give 
"gen-op" funding for are pushing nonprofits to demonstrate quantitative evaluation 
of their work, and sometimes completely shifting to support only project/program 
work. While this may seems reasonable to the outside observer, this has the terrible 
consequence of cutting off many organizations at the knees because they are losing 
the funding that would pay for them to keep the lights on, pay salaries, and other 
essential activities of a healthy organization. 

To remedy this problem of general funding, CiviCRM is doing what many nonprofits do: 
they are considering something like a membership model that would require a small 
amount of dues, either once in a lifetime or on an ongoing basis, from anyone who 
uses CiviCRM. This might raise hackles: "Wait, I thought CiviCRM was FREE?!" but 
if the amount is small enough from enough organizations, it might be the solution 
to a more robust funding model that can keep CiviCRM healthy and make it possible 
to hire more development staff to keep fixing bugs and making CiviCRM a better tool 
for the nonprofit sector.
