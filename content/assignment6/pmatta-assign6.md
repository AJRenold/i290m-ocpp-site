ASSIGNMENT 6: Where does the funding for you community come from? Is there corporate sponsorship? A foundation that backs it? Do users donate? How does this affect the community's cooperative dynamics? Are there competing projects? How would you describe your project's role in the greater technical ecosystem?

# Funding of Geonode 
To understanding the present funding mechanism in Geonode opensource software, one has to understand the origins of Geonode. OpenGeo is a leader in open source geospatial software development and support. It is a social enterprise working to build the best web-based geospatial technology and developed GeoNode, a new platform designed to promote the development of spatial data infrastructures (SDIs) worldwide. Initially, it was purely an open source project. 

As Geonode expanded from simple mapping application to a comprehensive robust system involving cartography, web design, and graphic design—especially in Django, Pinax, GeoServer, and OpenLayers; in March 2010, Geonode called out for partners to further develop their growing project [in their blogpost](http://geonode.org/2010/03/looking-for-partners/index.html). The company seeks to bring the best practices of open source software to geospatial organizations around the world by providing enterprises with supported, tested, and integrated open source solutions to build the Geospatial Web.
