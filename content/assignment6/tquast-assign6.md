Summary: How and by who is Hypothes.is funded and how does it affect the project?

##Who is funding hypothes.is?##
Hypothes.is is funded through donations. Hypothes.is has chosen an interesting way to get money for an open source project. It was founded through [Kickstarter](http://www.kickstarter.com/) on the 13 of November 2011. Although some of the code already existed before the campaign, the project truly took off after Kickstarter. Hypothes.is' states on the Kickstarter page:

> The project until now has been self-funded, but in order to deliver a working prototype, we need to bring in funding to feed our developers and cover basic administrative costs.  $100,000 will allow us to get started. 

Interesting here is to note, that hypothes.is barely made it by being funded 106%, reaching the goal just a few hours before the deadline. Also the distribution of donors is noteworthy, as nearly half of the money was given by four people donating $10.000. 

But hypothes.is is not only backed up by the Kickstarter campaign. As stated on the [donor page](http://hypothes.is/donors/) are some foundations supporting it, namely [The Andrew W. Mellon Foundation](http://www.mellon.org/), [The Shuttleworth Foundation](http://www.shuttleworthfoundation.org/) and [The Alfred P. Sloan Foundation](http://www.sloan.org/). On top of this did a person called Sunil Paul donate more than $100.000. 

It is still possible to donate to the project, but the numbers are not public.

##How does this affect the community?##
A company needs money to operate and thus will the people giving the money always have some kind of influence on the project. This said I have not experienced any direct interference by hypothes.is' donors. This may be mainly caused by the way the money is given to hypothes.is. The very [definition](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Donation) of donation is that you do not expect anything in return. However it can't be denied that hypothes.is has to please it's donors to ensure continuing support. Here it helps that hypothes.is has defined [12 principles](http://hypothes.is/principles/) it complies to. It can be used as a common ground between hypothes.is and the donors and it concisely sums up what hypothes.is stands for. 

Reading through the comments of the backers and Kickstarter and the websites of the foundations it looks like they support hypothes.is because they believe in the cause, more than they try to get a concrete measurable gain. This reflects the hypothes.is community. All the people I have been able to talk to work on hypothes.is because they believe in the tool and that it can change the way the internet works today. 

##Hypothes.is related to the greater ecosystem##

##Conclusion##


ASSIGNMENT 6: Where does the funding for you community come from? Is there corporate sponsorship? A foundation that backs it? Do users donate? How does this affect the community's cooperative dynamics? Are there competing projects? How would you describe your project's role in the greater technical ecosystem?
