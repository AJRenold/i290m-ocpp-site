Summary: How and by who is Hypothes.is funded and how does it affect the project?

##Who is funding hypothes.is?##
Hypothes.is is funded through donations. Hypothes.is has chosen an interesting way to get money for an open source project. It was founded through [Kickstarter](http://www.kickstarter.com/) on the 13 of November 2011. Although some of the code already existed before the campaign, the project truly took off after Kickstarter. Hypothes.is' states on the Kickstarter page:

> The project until now has been self-funded, but in order to deliver a working prototype, we need to bring in funding to feed our developers and cover basic administrative costs.  $100,000 will allow us to get started. 

Interesting here is to note, that hypothes.is barely made it by being funded 106%, reaching the goal just a few hours before the deadline. Also the distribution of donors is noteworthy, as nearly half of the money was given by four people donating $10.000. 

But hypothes.is is not only backed up by the Kickstarter campaign. As stated on the [donor page](http://hypothes.is/donors/) are some foundations supporting it, namely [The Andrew W. Mellon Foundation](http://www.mellon.org/), [The Shuttleworth Foundation](http://www.shuttleworthfoundation.org/) and [The Alfred P. Sloan Foundation](http://www.sloan.org/). On top of this did a person called Sunil Paul donate more than $100.000. 

It is still possible to donate to the project, but the numbers are not public.
