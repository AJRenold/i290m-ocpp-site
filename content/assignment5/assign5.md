Summary: Finalize the survey that will be the research instrument for the class report.

We have discussed in class, in lab, and on the mailing list the process by which we will write the class report.

The next and important step is finalizing the survey that you will each need to answer with respect to your project and your participation in it.

Each student is responsible for one question or set of questions, though two or more students may combine efforts to coordinate questions around a particular topic.  You will be responsible for analyzing the results of your question, in the context of the rest of the responses.

This is an opportunity to ask a question that reflects your unique background and interests.  If you are interested in the technology and tools behind these projects, you are welcome to ask a question that probes into that area.  If you are more interested in questions about the social and organizational dynamics, you are welcome to ask into that as well. And so on.

Our hope is that the final paper will be a synthesis of your interests and expertise, and be informed by the course material.  So, by way of example: there may be interesting patterns that we can only see if we look carefully at BOTH the tools used in these projects AND the organizational dynamics.  Are any of these features correlated in a suprising way?

Another approach to thinking about questions is to draw directly from the literature we have read in class.  This course work is a great opportunity to test the hypotheses of other papers in new contexts.

You are *highly* encouraged to bring up your questions on the class mailing list and do your work in coordination with others.
