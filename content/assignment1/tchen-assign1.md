Summary: The story behind building the PeerLibrary project

October, 2012
It was Connor's 20th birthday and there was a low key absinthe gathering at his apartment. At the time, I recently withdrew from classes at UC Berkeley for an indeterminate amount of time to start a data infrastructure company in San Francisco. This was when I first met Rodrigo, Spencer and Nicolai - new friends of Connor whom he met at the Berkeley Student Co-op Casa Zimbabwe. Rodrigo and Spencer were hacking on an open source collaborative multitracking recording app for Android devices called Radiotape. Nicolai was taking a course on music and cognition and was thrilled about his plans for his final project. Our interests immediately aligned and we talked about the latent potential for open source technology to shape society. We made plans to collaborate in the near future.

I reconnected with Mek, a former co-worker. We met at a hipster-infested coffeehouse in SoMA to catch up on our latest projects. Mek was working on [Waltz](https://github.com/mekarpeles/waltz), a python application framework for "designing web apps in 3/4 the time" based off the minimalist web.py stack. This conversation was pivotal in helping me realize the power of the open source development and the self-enhancing nature of the collaboration model. I relocated to Vancouver for a month to take some time off from my daily duties at my startup to reevaluate how I can contribute to this open source world. I got exposed to development communities of peer-to-peer tools such as cryptocurrencies (Bitcoin, Namecoin) and encryption software (PGP, Tor). Naturally, I was drawn to the underlying theories behind each new technological discovery and spent my hiatus reading academic literature on said topics. I remember jumping through many hurdles to obtain an economics paper because I no longer had JSTOR access as a non-student. It dawned on me that the academic publishing model was broken and access to scientific research and scholarly literature is a problem I took for granted. I made a commitment to dedicate my new few months (or years!) to respond to this problem.

I return to Berkeley with a few ideas I wanted to implement and met with Rodrigo and Connor along with Rishi Sharma, an eccentric electrical engineer with a flair for signals processing. Rodrigo was finalizing his codebase for Radiotape and Rishi was writing software for his EEG. That night also coincided with the news of the death of Aaron Swartz which sparked a pertinent conversation on open access both as a political and software movement. We decided to draft an "Open Access Manifesto" and eventually disseminate it across all major research institutions.

There was another low key absinthe gathering at Casa Zimbabwe, this time for Rodrigo's birthday. That night, Rodrigo and I discussed the potential for building version control software for academic and public policy documents. I was recently inspired by Germany's decision to host their [legislative documentation](https://github.com/bundestag/gesetze) on Github and thought this could extend to public research and democratic deliberations. It turned out that Rodrigo and I independently formulated these ideas in the past and have already started their nascent implementations. This was how [PeerLibrary](http://github.com/peerlibrary) was born. Over the following days we attended a symposium held by Lawrence Lessig and later a talk by Daniel Ellsberg which solidified our views on transparency, open access and decentralizing information.

We immediately started coding a prototype for PeerLibrary and indexing millions of open access articles. At the time, the main contributors were Nihil (a talented cryptoanarchist bit pusher with a panache for axiomatic set theory), Rodrigo and I. In the same week, we took our conversation about PeerLibrary to the Internet Archive. Mek introduced us to folks who work there and we demo'd our ambitious idea of the future of scholarly collaboration to Brewster Kahle and his colleagues as well as some friends from Noisebridge. The meeting was a success and convinced us to continue building and expanding PeerLibrary's funtionality.

Concurrently, Rodrigo, Connor, Rishi and I were feeling a little mischievous and started writing data extraction scripts to compile *.edu email addresses from the public directories of major research universities and institutions. Our targets included: Harvard, MIT, CalTech, Stanford, UC Berkeley, UCSF, Yale, Princeton, Columbia, UCLA, National Institutes of Health and NASA. Our intention was to disseminate a document of which its contents called for the liberation of research literature to the public. This was actually pretty fun (we ran into some problems when scraping Harvard Medical School because the email addresses were encoded as jpegs so we ran OCR to extract the text from the images) and was quite a distraction from our development of PeerLibrary.
