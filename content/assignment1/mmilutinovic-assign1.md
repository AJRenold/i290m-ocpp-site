[PeerLibrary](http://peerlibrary.org) is a fresh project so vivid open source community does not yet exist around it. Current developers are meeting mostly in person and necessary technological and social infrastructure for new contributors has been missing. But in the course of the first assignment we were approached by two new contributors, Anna and Seema, which resulted in improving all those aspects and become more open to future contributors as well.

As a consequence we now have a [development mailing list](http://lists.peerlibrary.org/lists/info/dev) and improved [README](https://github.com/peerlibrary/peerlibrary), better explaining how to setup a development instance of PeerLibrary and possible ways to start contributing and even just contacting others involved in the project.

Because even new contributors are local, we meet few times in person, to easier discuss basics and ideas, but at the same time we started encouraging online presence. For example, posting to the mailing list and using pull requests so that others can follow the development. This is especially important because we do already have some waiting and quiet members of the mailing list and we hope to engage them in this way as well.
