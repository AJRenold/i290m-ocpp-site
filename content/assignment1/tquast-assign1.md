#ASSIGNMENT 1 - Approaching the community#

##What am I working on##
I have chosen to contribute to [Hypothes.is](http://hypothes.is/) throughout this course and hopefully beyond that. Hypothes.is is an online highlighting tool, which allows users to highlight, comment and share content on websites. The idea of being able to annotate, tag and interconnect content regardless of its type or form reminds me of Tim Berners-Lee's vision of [the semantic web](http://www.scientificamerican.com/article.cfm?id=the-semantic-web), which makes it an highly interesting project to work on. There are several highlighting tools on the internet, but none has gathered a significant number of users yet. Hypothes.is combination of open source [principles](http://hypothes.is/principles/), backup from the [community](http://www.kickstarter.com/projects/dwhly/hypothesis-taking-peer-review-to-the-internet) and its passionate [core-team](http://hypothes.is/who/), makes it stand out and worthwhile to work for.

##What can I offer##
Before I decided to join the list of contributors I had to consider what I can offer to the project. After having taken a quick look at their [git-repository](https://github.com/hypothesis/h/) I can tell that their developers several years work-experience and it will be hard for me to a join this mature project, which has its own rule-sets and workarounds. On the other hand I have worked two years on [cast.li](http://cast.li) which is an highlighting tool too. I stopped development on project by the end of last year after struggling with attracting new users. Somehow is Hypothes.is the proof that the concept holds and I can contribute to it becoming a success by applying the first hand knowledge I gained through cast.li. This said, I have several years of programming experience, so with help from the hypothes.is team I should quickly get up to speed with coding.

##First contact##
The first time I heard about Hypothes.is was when I attended the UI class at the iSchool. Jake Hartnell who happens to be Hypothes.is' product manager was taking the same class. We quickly got into a discussion about the usefulness of highlighting on the internet and I showed him cast.li. His reaction was very positive and he asked me if I wanted to help developing hypothes.is, and because of the above mentioned reasons it was not hard to convince me. Generally speaking was the first contact very informal. I ran by accident into Jake and it developed from there.

##Communication channels##
Hypothes.is uses several communication channels to stay in contact with their contributors and to keep track of the development. 
The first source of information is their extensive [website](http://hypothes.is/). It offers many kinds of information, including a page explaining how to contribute.
The most important source is the git-repository called [h](https://github.com/hypothesis/h/). It includes all the core files and changes made. Especially interesting for new contributors are the INSTALL files which include a step to step guide to get the server running on different operating systems.
They also use a [mailing list](mailto:dev+subscribe@list.hypothes.is) and an [archive](http://list.hypothes.is/archive/dev/). It seems that the mailing list is not very active at the moment, but there has been some communication in the past. It has been mostly used for communication with external partners.
There is also a [forum](https://groups.google.com/forum/#!forum/hypothesis-forum). It looks like it's new since the archive only goes back two months. Here most of the threads are started by user reporting some kind of a problem or bug.
They promote a IRC channel [#hypothes.is](http://webchat.freenode.net/?channels=hypothes.is) on the website for people to go to when they need help. I have been there several days, and although there are about 20 people in the chat-room did no one talk. I think that people know each other in the chat and mostly use it for contacting others via PMs.
For developers they link to a [site](https://github.com/hypothesis/h/blob/develop/CONTRIBUTING.rst) where the coding style is explained together with other practicalities like licensing and how to branch correctly.
The last thing which is worth mentioning is their [issue tracker](https://github.com/hypothesis/h/issues). They use git's standard tracker with tags for categorizing the issues.

##Barriers##
I faced two main barriers while approaching the community.
Firstly I wanted to contribute, but I did not know how and what. It is hard to understand where help is needed if you look at a repository of several hundred files, not counting the dependencies. Also the issue tracker didn't help much, since the reported issues were hard to understand without deeper knowledge of the hypothes.is-tool.  
Secondly I was drowned in communication channels. There is a mailing list, an IRC chat, a wiki, github, a issue tracker, a forum and a website. It is hard to know where to find information when you are new to most of the technologies. All the informations are scattered between the tools and it's challenging to gain an overview. It is also not trivial to ask questions, since there are several possible places and you don't want to misuse one of the channels. 

##Important milestones##

##Did you follow a 'script'?##


Was it a formal or informal process? 

Did you face any barriers to participation? 
There has been high entry barriers, although Hypothes.is has a website devoted to contributors.
There were two main reasons for this:
I: I have never worked on an open source project, and I have no experience in how to get involved. Communication is spread across IRC, Mailinglists, GITHub and the Issue tracker and it is very complicated to get a consistant picture of the situation. 
II: I have not used their tools before. I think I can contribute with my front end-knowledge (JS, HTML, CSS), which accourding to their github repository makes up more than 4/5 of the code. The problem is though that I've not used their tools before. The dependencies to run their code are:
Python v2.7+
CoffeeScript v1.6+
Sass v3.2+
Compass v0.12+
ElasticSearch v0.19+
While I've heard of all of them, except elasticSearch, I have no experience in using them. The installation and configuration alone has taken several days for me (windows 8 is not the best supported OS for these tools). 


Do you think your experience was personal or general? 

Include a link to the email archives of your project (or forum, if there are no email archives).  Ideally, you should post to the message you used to introduce yourself to the group.  If that is not appropriate for some reason, please provide the next best thing.  We are looking for evidence that you have identified the technical infrastructure of the project and used it to engage the community directly.
