#ASSIGNMENT 1 - Approaching the community#

##What am I working on##
I have chosen to contribute to [Hypothes.is](http://hypothes.is/) throughout this course and hopefully beyond that. Hypothes.is is an online highlighting tool, which allows users to highlight, comment and share content on websites. The idea of being able to annotate, tag and interconnect content regardless of its type or form reminds me of Tim Berners-Lee's vision of [the semantic web](http://www.scientificamerican.com/article.cfm?id=the-semantic-web), which makes it an highly interesting project to work on. There are several highlighting tools on the internet, but none has gathered a significant number of users yet. Hypothes.is combination of open source [principles](http://hypothes.is/principles/), backup from the [community](http://www.kickstarter.com/projects/dwhly/hypothesis-taking-peer-review-to-the-internet) and its passionate [core-team](http://hypothes.is/who/), makes it stand out and worthwhile to work for.

##What can I offer##
Before I decided to join the list of contributors I had to consider what I can offer to the project. After having taken a quick look at their [git-repository](https://github.com/hypothesis/h/) I can tell that their developers several years work-experience and it will be hard for me to a join this mature project, which has its own rule-sets and workarounds. On the other hand I have worked two years on [cast.li](http://cast.li) which is an highlighting tool too. I stopped development on project by the end of last year after struggling with attracting new users. Somehow is Hypothes.is the proof that the concept holds and I can contribute to it becoming a success by applying the first hand knowledge I gained through cast.li. This said, I have several years of programming experience, so with help from the hypothes.is team I should quickly get up to speed with coding.

##First contact##


##Did you follow a 'script'?##


Was it a formal or informal process? 

Did you face any barriers to participation? 
There has been high entry barriers, although Hypothes.is has a website devoted to contributors.
There were two main reasons for this:
I: I have never worked on an open source project, and I have no experience in how to get involved. Communication is spread across IRC, Mailinglists, GITHub and the Issue tracker and it is very complicated to get a consistant picture of the situation. 
II: I have not used their tools before. I think I can contribute with my front end-knowledge (JS, HTML, CSS), which accourding to their github repository makes up more than 4/5 of the code. The problem is though that I've not used their tools before. The dependencies to run their code are:
Python v2.7+
CoffeeScript v1.6+
Sass v3.2+
Compass v0.12+
ElasticSearch v0.19+
While I've heard of all of them, except elasticSearch, I have no experience in using them. The installation and configuration alone has taken several days for me (windows 8 is not the best supported OS for these tools). 


Do you think your experience was personal or general? 

Include a link to the email archives of your project (or forum, if there are no email archives).  Ideally, you should post to the message you used to introduce yourself to the group.  If that is not appropriate for some reason, please provide the next best thing.  We are looking for evidence that you have identified the technical infrastructure of the project and used it to engage the community directly.
